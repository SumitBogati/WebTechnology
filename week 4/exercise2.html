      PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows in 2017, but has since been released for a number of other platforms, including Android and iOS mobile devices.
      In PUBG, players are dropped onto a large, open island and must scavenge for weapons, ammunition, and other supplies while fighting to be the last person or team standing. The island's terrain, which includes forests, towns, and military bases, is randomly generated and changes in every match. Players can choose to play in solo, duo, or squad mode, with the latter allowing them to team up with friends and communicate with each other using in-game voice chat.
      PUBG Mobile, the mobile version of the game, has become one of the most popular mobile games in the world. It features many of the same gameplay elements as the PC version, but has been optimized for touchscreen devices and has a number of unique features, such as the ability to play with friends in a squad. In addition to the battle royale mode, the game also includes a number of other modes, such as arcade mode, which features shorter matches with various gameplay twists, and the new Team Deathmatch mode, which pits teams against each other in fast-paced, objective-based matches.
